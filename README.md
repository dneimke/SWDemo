Playing around with offline web

Goal is to have an 'online first' approach but, within the website, have certain pages (tools) which work offline.

* Each tool should be totally functional offline
* Users should know when they have data that needs to be sync'd online
* The saving experience for each tool's state should let the user know that it is being stored offline
